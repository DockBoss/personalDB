# personalDB
A personal database to do various tasks

I am currently working on the todo list feature of this project.
I have plans on adding the following features:
* personal calander that will render todo tasks and other custom events
* Contact book
* Time management tools
* budgeting tools
* personal notebook to organize thoughts and ideas

## Topics being learned
* CSS
  * The tedious task of bringing my creative vision to life using CSS
* React
   * Styled-components
* Node.js
  * express 
* MongoDB
  * Mongoose 

Thats about it so far, but believe me it sure is a lot of learning.
Progress is being made though, I will eventually have implement a test version for anyone to download and try out.
