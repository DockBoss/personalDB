## Notes

### HTTP

HTTP is a TCP/IP based application layer protocol <look into that

* http is connection-less
  * meaning that after the request is sent to the server, the server will disconnect and reconnect only when the server is ready to respond 
* http can deliver any data
* http is stateless, meaning that the client and server only know about other when they are connected, and have to "introduce" themselves each time
*
